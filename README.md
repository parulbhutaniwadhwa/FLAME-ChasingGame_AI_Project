FLAME - Friend, Love, Affair, Marriage, Enemy
The game is inspired by a common snake game where a boy chases for all the 5 characters and loses points if hits an Enemy. 
The model runs the pattern of the game after playing it multiple times. As a result it decreases the penalty and continues to increase the score.
Reinforcement Learning (q -learning methodology) has been implemented to build it successfully.
